TASK 2 - SIMPLE CALCULATOR

Develop a calculator program that performs basic arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction,
multiplication, and division. Allow the user to input two numbers and choose an operation to perform.


# include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main() {

  char op;  //stores the operation to be performed like addition, subtraction, multiplication or division.
  float num1, num2;    //stores the numbers between which the operation is to be performed.

  cout << "Enter operator: +, -, *, /: ";
  cin >> op;                //takes the operator as input from the user

  cout << "Enter two operands: ";
  cin >> num1 >> num2;    //takes the two numbers as input from the user

  switch(op) {      switch statement on the basis of operation provided by user

    case '+':      //Addition
      cout << num1 << " + " << num2 << " = " << num1 + num2;       //add the two numbers provided by the user and print the answer in output.
      break;

    case '-':     //Subtraction
      cout << num1 << " - " << num2 << " = " << num1 - num2;      //subtracts the two numbers provided by the user and print the answer in output.
      break;

    case '*':  //Multiplication
      cout << num1 << " * " << num2 << " = " << num1 * num2;     //multiplies the two numbers provided by the user and print the answer in output.
      break;

    case '/':   //Division
      cout << num1 << " / " << num2 << " = " << num1 / num2;    //divides the two numbers provided by the user and print the answer in output.
      break;

    default:
     cout << "Error! operator is not correct";       // If the operator is other than +, -, * or /, then error message is shown
      break;
  }
                     //The break statement is used in a switch statement after every case to exit the switch block once a matching case is found. Without the break statement, control would "fall through" to subsequent cases, leading to wrong answer.

  return 0;
}
