TASK 1 - NUMBER GUESSING GAME

Create a program that generates a random number and asks the user to guess it. Provide feedback on
whether the guess is too high or too low until the user guesses the correct number.

Code:-

#include <iostream>
#include <cstdlib>  //This header file provides several functions involving memory allocation, random number generation, and other utility functions like srand() and rand()
#include <ctime>  //provides functionality related to time and date in the C++ Standard Library. One of the most commonly used function from this header is std::time().
using namespace std;

int main()
{
int num=0;                          //it will store the randomly generated number.
int guess=0;                        //it will take the guess as an input from user.
int tries=0;                        //it will store the number of tries the user had done until guess is made correctly.
	srand(time(0));                 //common way to seed the random number generator 
	num = rand() % 100 + 1;         // to generate a random number between 1 and 100
	cout << "Guess The Number\n";

	do
	{
		cout << "Enter a guess between 1 and 100 : ";
		cin >> guess;
		tries++;

		if (guess > num)     //checks if guess is greater than number generated randomly. If it is true, it will print that the guess is too high as compared to the original number.
			cout << "Too high! Try Again\n\n";
		else if (guess < num)   //checks if guess is smaller than number generated randomly. If it is true, it will print that the guess is too low as compared to the original number.
			cout << "Too low! Try Again\n\n";
		else
			cout << "\nWell Done! You got it in " << tries << " guesses!\n";  //checks if guess is equal to the number generated randomly. If it is true, it will print that the guess is right.
	} while (guess != num);     //this loop will run until guess is not equal to the number generated randomly.

	return 0;
}
